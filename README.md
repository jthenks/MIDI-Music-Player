# MIDI-Music-Player
This program reads music files and plays those files back through an instrument.

This program was originally a school assignment. If you'd like to read the assignment requirements, they are located in the "Instructions_for_Assignment2.md" file.

The purpose of this project was to show that we could write a program that could successfully read, and play music that was written in a specific format. 

I took this assigment a step further, and converted "Mary Had A Little Lamb" (by ear) into the requested format. 
When prompted to "Please enter the file name:" enter "littleLamb.music" to hear it play.
